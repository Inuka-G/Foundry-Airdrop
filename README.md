# Ethereum Airdrop - Powered by Foundry

This project showcases an Ethereum Airdrop smart contract built and deployed using the **Foundry** toolkit. Leverage Foundryâ€™s high-performance suite for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

## About Foundry

**Foundry** is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It comes with a collection of powerful tools to assist in every aspect of smart contract development:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (similar to Hardhat and Truffle).
- **Cast**: A versatile tool to interact with EVM smart contracts and query blockchain data.
- **Anvil**: A local Ethereum node for rapid development, similar to Ganache or Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: A fast and functional Solidity REPL for rapid prototyping.
